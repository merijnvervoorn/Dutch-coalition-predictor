# 📊 Ideological Divergence and Dutch Democracy

This group project is part of the Bachelor in Computational Social Science. We are using a comprehensive database of speeches from the Tweede Kamer (the Dutch House of Representatives) to analyze how ideological divergence affects the state of democracy in the Netherlands.



## 🔍 Overview

This project leverages machine learning and AI modeling to explore the dynamics of political discourse in the Netherlands. By analyzing speech data, we aim to understand the implications of increasing inter- and intra-partisan ideological divergence on democratic processes.


## 🎯 Research Question

Draft: **What implications (for democracy) does the increase of inter- and intra-partisan ideological divergence have?**


## 💾 Data Source

- **Political Speech Dataset:** Speeches from the Tweede Kamer. Fetched from [opendata.tweedekamer.nl](https://opendata.tweedekamer.nl/)


## 🤝 Stakeholders

- **DemocratieMonitor:** Our primary stakeholder, providing key insights and contextual feedback.
- Other academic and policy-making bodies that might be interested in the project.



## 🔧 Setup & Requirements

- **Programming Language:** Python 3 (or your preferred data analysis tools)
- **Key Libraries:** scikit-learn, pandas, nltk, matplotlib, and others as needed.
- **Environment:** A standard Python development environment (Jupyter Notebook is recommended for exploration).

*Note: Detailed installation instructions and dependencies will be added as the project develops.*
